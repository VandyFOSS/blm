# Black Lives Matter
We, members and officers of vFOSS, condemn the systemic racism and
oppression in American society that has led to the deaths of George
Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless other Black
people. These actions have shocked and saddened us, and we denounce
unjust deaths at the hands of institutional racism.

Therefore, we believe that we must act against these forces in our
capacity. The core tenets of the Open Source and Free Software
movements embody the belief that everyone, regardless of their race
can participate in some of the greatest collaborative projects in
human history.

We do not have the solutions to injustice, but we can help support
change-making organizations. Our action comes in the form of
self-education, listening and donations. We encourage members of the
Open Source community to be informed and to take action, whether it be
by calling and writing to your representatives, taking part in
peaceful demonstrations, signing petitions or donating to non-profit
organizations.
